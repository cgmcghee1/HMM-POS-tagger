This is my first attempt at a POS tagger using a Hidden Markov Model.
 
It's incredibly slow and pretty horribly innacurate so please don't use it to actually tag anything. I'm planning to eventually extend the tagger to trigrams
and implement a beam search algorithm, but this version is simply to test out using GitHub
